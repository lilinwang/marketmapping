                    <h2> The Problem </h2>
                    <p>Mapping the competitive landscape of a new industry has traditionally been a tremendously 

unstructured and painstaking process.  marketmap.me allows founders, venture capitalists, and 

investment analysts to quickly develop an industry market map on the fly.  We source and size 

logo images and let you decide how to position the competition on dimensions of your choice.  

The entire process takes less than 30 seconds to complete.</p>

                    <p>Our team set out to identify a way to produce reliable market landscapes based on quantifiable 

data.  We engaged in extensive research efforts to pinpoint sources of such quantifiable data.  

Unfortunately, very few tangible metrics of substance are available, especially for new and 

relatively undefined markets.  Companies such as DataFox© and Mattermark© provide the 

concrete metrics which can be ascertained from existing sources; among them, Twitter followers, 

Linkedin followers, Alexa rank, and funding history.  As such, there is little additional value that 

can be added for founders and investors that are interested in comparing companies based on 

these quantifiable metrics.  In speaking with founders and investors, our team identified a very 

real and frustrating challenge - accurately mapping landscapes on non-quantifiable metrics such 

as ease of use, customer segmentation, reputation, etc.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Our Failures</h2>

                    <p>Our team explored various options for creating standardized market maps based on qualitative 

dimensions.  However, such data simply does not exist objectively.  We next tried to execute 

survey-based approaches to gather sentiments of founders and investors.  This attempt was not 

well received by our targeted audience, and highlighted to us that each case of creating a market 

map was a very unique and generally non-repeatable endeavor.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Our Lessons Learned</h2>

                    <p>Our engagement with individuals who need to create market maps has led us to the hypothesis that visualization of a new company’s position against its competitors through different lenses can be the best way to communicate to investors or consumers where a company lies within its competitive landscape, and convey how the company creates value and differentiates itself.  In particular, our team has identified the three most relevant and revealing templates for mapping market landscapes:  XY market maps, petal diagrams, and flow charts.  Below, we illustrate each of these three templates for Authorea©, a collaborative research platform, and describe the advantages of each type of visualization.</p>

                    <span class="meta" style="font-weight:bold">XY Market Maps</span>

                    <blockquote>An XY Market Map is used to compare the players in a given industry on two

dimensions.  It should be used to demonstrate how your company is superior to its 

competition on a combination of two specific attributes.  The XY Market Map is the best 

choice to express product differentiation.</blockquote>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">Traditional Positional Map</span>
                    <span class="meta" style="font-weight:bold">Petal Diagrams</span>
                    <blockquote>Petal diagrams demonstrate where within a crowded landscape your company intends to 

play.  It should be used to illustrate that your company serves a variety of industries 

and/or markets, and signal that your potential market size is very large.</blockquote>
                  
                        <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="img/petal.png" alt="">
                    <span class="meta" style="font-weight:bold">Flow Charts</span>
                    <blockquote>Flow charts show your company’s position in a value chain – how you are filling a 

critical gap within an existing process.  It will directly list your complementors; that is, 

businesses and services that directly provide you input or use your output.</blockquote>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Our Solution</h2>

                    <p>Marketmap.me is a crowd-sourced market-mapping platform available to users for free to create

market maps on the fly.  Current best practices available for strategic and competitive analysis 

are exclusively concentrated on established and/or large companies and markets. At present, 

there are no trusted services for creating market maps and competitor analyses for new industry 

companies or sectors; in particular those that are disrupting existing markets or creating new 

ones – companies like Uber©, Airbnb©, and Coinbase©.</p>

<p>On our platform, users can seamlessly identify their company and their competitors.  Next, users 

can specify their intended graph type for comparison.  marketmap.me sources company logos 

from the internet and standardizes their size.  Then, users can choose one of the three types of 

positioning graphs discussed above:  traditional XY market maps, petal diagrams, and flow 

charts.  Users are subsequently prompted to fill in their axis labels.</p>

<p>Marketmap.me will build a crowd-sourced database of market maps for emerging industries 

based on which companies our users are including in their market maps, where they are 

positioning companies relative to one another on the map, and which axes users are selecting to 

compare related companies.  Over time, this repository of data will allow us to recommend 

market map styles, relevant competitors, axes for comparison, and relative positioning of 

companies on competitive landscapes.  marketmap.me will quantify previously unquantifiable 

comparison dimensions for new, developing industries; and has the potential to become the 

standard, objective means for competitive market mapping.</p>
